What I have learned with this project is that coding a video game takes a lot of patience. No project is ever perfect as I came to a bunch of difficulties with this project.
The biggest difficulty that I have faced on this project is trying to add a score code because I felt like my game was unfinished and the reason why I had problems imputing a score code on my BreakBall Wall video game was because of syntax errors which annoyed me a lot so I ended up scrapping the score code :(
What I really enjoyed during this project is that I was able to create a video game with pygame on Python because since this is my first ever coding class, I was glad with the outcome of this project with the help of youtube videos
