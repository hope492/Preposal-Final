# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

BreakBall Wall

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A video game inspired by Breakout that lets you destroy any wall with a paddle and a ball

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
In BreakBall Wall, the objective of the game is pretty simple, break all the pieces of a wall (not just bricks) with simply using a moveable paddle to direct where the ball is going to hit. What my software Pygame will do for BreakWall Ball is that it allow the user to play the game in a 2D Mario-Style graphic. The features that my videogame will have is that it will have a main menu to start the game, a highscore label, and you can choose (while being in the main menu) any type of color of what you want your ball and paddle to be. This will executed with adding using the Mario coding, sound effect files, and using Pygame.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

What I will accomplish from this project no matter what is that I will finally say that I learned how to code for the first time ever.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The thing that I think I can accomplish is using the Mario coding from a previous lab to help lay a basis of what I need to do for this project.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The thing I hope to accomplish is that I hope my project is good enough as this entire course introduced me to coding for the first time ever.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps after this project is that I will finally learn on what it means to be in the field of Computer Science with coding. The new skills that I will need to require is learning how to use Pygame for this project. The topics that I will need to research is to learn the basis of 2D Pixelated Gaming with using Python by watching Youtube videos in order for me to lay the foundation on what I need to do for my project. Another topic that I need to research is how Pygame is used correctly and for my search I will use Mario as an example for my research.
